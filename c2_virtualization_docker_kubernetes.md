# Virtualization

In essence, virtualization allows you to create multiple "virtual" instances of computer resources within a single physical server or across a cluster of servers. These virtual instances, often referred to as virtual machines (VMs) or containers, enable data engineers to compartmentalize and optimize their data processing workloads.

Virtual machines (VMs) are powerful tools in the realm of data engineering, offering a way to create isolated, self-contained computing environments within a single physical server or across multiple servers.

Containers are like virtualized environments for your applications and data workflows. They bundle together your code, libraries, and configurations, ensuring consistency and eliminating conflicts. This means you can run complex data engineering tasks without worrying about compatibility issues.
